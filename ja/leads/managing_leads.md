# Manage Leads

The manage leads page is the main interface through which you can view and interact with your leads - both anonymous leads and those with additional information available.

## Lead Lists

The lead list is the default tabular view of all the leads in the system - by default the 'list view' is enabled, but you can also choose to switch to the 'grid view' which uses avatars to depict the leads visually using 'cards'. Clicking the appropriate button on the top right will allow you to switch between the two views.

Hint: If you prefer using keyboard shortcuts you can enter "t" on your keyboard to dynamically switch to table view and "c" to switch to the card view.

## Searching for leads

The lead list can be searched using the box at the top of the list, and can be ordered using the table headings by clicking on the heading you wish to sort the list by.

The search box allows many different search types and follows the same search process and variables as found in all other search layouts. You can learn more about the powerful search options available on the search documentation page.

## Adding leads quickly

If you have leads you would like to quickly add to Mautic manually, and they are not in the system as part of the normal workflow (for example by completing an enquiry form or having been imported) you can use the Quick Add Lead button to add them to the system.

You can of course also add them through the New Lead form and add much more detail but for quick entry this is the easiest and fastest way to get the lead into the system.

## Adding leads normally

If you have leads to import and you have time to add all the information, click on the dropdown arrow to the right of 'Quick Add Lead' and select 'New'.  This opens the new lead screen, where you can enter all the information you have about the lead.  Use the tabs at the top to add custom fields and social network profiles.

## Importing leads

Mautic offers the ability to import leads from other sources via CSV file - this is a great way to get up and running quickly if you need to import a lot of leads at once.

To use the import facility, make sure that you first have all the fields set up under 'Manage fields' which correspond to the information you are importing - you don't want to lose any data if at all possible.

Once you have created all the lead fields, click on the dropdown arrow to the right of the Quick Add Lead button, and select 'Import'.

Upload your CSV file, and ensure that you match the delimiter, enclosure and escape characters so that the importer can understand the data.

When you click on 'Upload' you will have the opportunity to match the fields found in the CSV file to the fields that you have in Mautic, which will allow the data to be correctly imported.

## Editing leads
To edit a lead, click on the name of the lead (or the IP address if the visitor is anonymous) to open the lead screen.

From this screen, you can view the recent events and any notes that have been made against the lead.

To edit the lead, click on the 'edit' button on the top-right menu.
