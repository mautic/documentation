# Campaigns

Campaigns are central to creating an automated workflow to assist with your marketing efforts. Campaigns consist of various external points of contact which will engage your leads. These engagements can be created to occur on predefined time intervals or in response to specific lead actions.

### Time Driven Campaigns

The concept of time driven campaigns implies a form of campaign which centers around specific timed events. These events are most usually in the form of emails. These email events can be defined to be triggered after a delay of a predefined number of days or on a specific date in the future.

### Lead Driven Campaigns

A second type of campaign is the lead driven campaign. These are campaigns which trigger events based on interactions from the lead. These can occur as a result of the lead landing on a certain page, opening an email, spending a specified amount of time on a website, or any number of other activities. The response to these actions would be an email sent either immediately or at some point in the future.

### Mixed Campaigns

Obviously you are not limited to creating either one kind of campaign or another separately. Mautic allows you to create campaigns which consist of both time driven items as well as lead driven actions. This powerful mixed campaign means actions will be driven by both specific dates or after specific timeframes as well as actions taken by a lead directly (as mentioned above).

### Campaign Actions

Email actions have been mentioned specifically as a particular use case, however there are many other responses the system can take. Other actions can include automatic assignment to a new lead list, assigning a new point value, or an integration into a CRM or other system.

### Campaign Automation

One of the main benefits of this campaign workflow process is the ability to predefine these workflows and have them respond automatically to your leads and timelines. This automation minimizes the amount of time required for manual lead activity and improves reliability of lead nurturing through consistent contact.
