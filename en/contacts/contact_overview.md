# Contact Overview

Each contact has a detail page where you can see what Mautic knows about him/her.

## Engagements/Points chart

The Engagements line chart display how active the contact was in the past 6 months. Engagement is any action the contact made. E.g. page hit, form submission, email open and so on. The chart displays also the points which the contact received.

## Avatar

Mautic will try to download the contact's avatar image based on his/her email address from the [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) service. But it can be loaded also from some social networks.

## History

The main tab displays the contact's action history sorted from the latest to the oldest. Each action will display as many details as there is about it. For example a form submission will display what values the contact submitted, the email send action will inform you whether the email was opened and when and so on. You can filter what actions you want to include or exclude from the timeline if you are searching for a specific one.

## Notes

Mautic can be used as a basic CRM. You or your teammates can write a notes to a specific contact. A note can be marked with a specific purpose: General, Email, Call, Meeting. It's also possible to define a date of a meeting or a call. If you do so, the note will also appear in the Mautic calendar.

## Social

If the social plugins like Facebook or Twitter are enabled and authorized and the contact provided you username for a social network, Mautic can display his/hers feed for the social network in the Social tab. Most of the social networks limited their API since the feature was developed so search by email is not working.

## Map

If Mautic knows the coordinates of the contact from a geolocation IP lookup service, it will display a forth tab with a map so you can easily see where in the world the contact is located. If Mautic knows more locations for this contact as he/she travels, you'll see all the locations there. If Mautic doesn't know any location, the tab won't show up.
