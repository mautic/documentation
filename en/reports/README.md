# Reports

Highly customizable reports can be generated through Mautic's Report menu.

## Configuration

Each report can be customized to include the columns of choice. Filter data based on set criteria and/or set a specific order for the data.
In addition you can also group by and select different function operators to calculate fields. Note that when you select functions operators a totals row will be added to the report. This totals row will not be exported when selecting to export a report.
