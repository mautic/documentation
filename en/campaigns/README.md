# Campaigns

Campaigns are central to creating an automated workflow to assist with your marketing efforts. Campaigns consist of various external points of contact which will engage your contacts. These engagements can be created to occur on predefined time intervals or in response to specific contact actions.

### Time Driven Campaigns

The concept of time driven campaigns implies a form of campaign which centers around specific timed events. These events are most usually in the form of emails. These email events can be defined to be triggered after a delay of a predefined number of days or on a specific date in the future.

### Contact Driven Campaigns

A second type of campaign is the contact driven campaign. These are campaigns which trigger events based on interactions from the contact. These can occur as a result of the contact landing on a certain page, opening an email, spending a specified amount of time on a website, or any number of other activities. The response to these actions would be an email sent either immediately or at some point in the future.

### Mixed Campaigns

Obviously you are not limited to creating either one kind of campaign or another separately. Mautic allows you to create campaigns which consist of both time driven items as well as contact driven actions. This powerful mixed campaign means actions will be driven by both specific dates or after specific timeframes as well as actions taken by a contact directly (as mentioned above).

### Campaign Actions

Email actions have been mentioned specifically as a particular use case, however there are many other responses the system can take. Other actions can include automatic assignment to a new segment, assigning a new point value, or an integration into a CRM or other system.

### Campaign Automation

One of the main benefits of this campaign workflow process is the ability to predefine these workflows and have them respond automatically to your contacts and timelines. This automation minimizes the amount of time required for manual contact activity and improves reliability of contact nurturing through consistent contact.
