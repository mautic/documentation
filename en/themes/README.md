# Themes

Themes control the look and feel of the Mautic landing pages, emails, forms and message screens.  A basic Mautic installation will come pre-packaged with a number of themes which can be used 'as-is' or adapted to suit specific projects.  It is also possible to [create a theme](https://developer.mautic.org/#themes) for Mautic from scratch.
