# Mautic - FullContact plugin

This plugin can:

- Pull data from Full Contact via the API about contacts and companies into Mautic.

### Requirements

- Mautic installed on a publicly accessible URL. This plugin won't work on a localhost because callbacks from FullContact to Mautic are necessary.
- Get a [Full Contact API key](https://portal.fullcontact.com/signup)

### Authorize the plugin

### Usage
On the contacts and on the companies pages, there are two buttons: One on the row dropdown menu, and another one on the toolbar at the top:

When clicking one of those buttons a window will pop up to confirm the action:

A few moments later, if information was found, the contact/company details will be updated.
